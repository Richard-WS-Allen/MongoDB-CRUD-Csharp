# MongoDB-CRUD-Csharp
MongoDB basic CRUD operations in C#

The three C# files contain the code to run a very basic UI and allow CRUD operations on a MongoDB collection named "courses"
The database structure is kept simple in this example but, could be expanded to allow maintaining data of multiple tees at different golf
courses. This would be useful in maintaining a handicap calculator for golfers to allow selecting courses and the tees they played from
when they input scores to track their handicap.
